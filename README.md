# Webcam hand drawing experiment

[An experiment](https://bence-toth.github.io/webcam-hand-drawing/) made with Handsfree.

Give permission for the browser to use your webcam and see the magic happen.

I might add controls later for:

- Hue shift speed
- Monochrome mode
- Line thickness
- Line fade time
